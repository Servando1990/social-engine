# Content Prompts

Put your content ideas here as markdown files.

## Example

Create a file like `new-feature.md`:

```markdown
# Post about new AI feature

I just built a feature that uses Claude to analyze user behavior patterns.
It reduced processing time by 60%.

Generate LinkedIn and Twitter posts highlighting:
- The problem we solved
- Technical approach
- Impact/results
- Key lesson learned
```

Then tell Amp: "Read WORKFLOW_FOR_AMP.md and run it"
